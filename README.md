## Introduction

This is a non commercial twitter application, which was created as a asignment for a university course i were attending. In this app, after you have registered, you can write tweets as in every messaging app. Also it is possible to follow your friends. You can watch their timeline or see what's globally happening. All this is included in Twitterroo. Also there is a first Aurelia SPA to use the views, but not every feature is implemented.

You can find a running example if you look at the links below.
